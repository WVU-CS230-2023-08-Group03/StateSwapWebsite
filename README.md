## Project Summary
Mountain State Swap

This platform serves as a trading hub for the people of Morgantown, enabling individuals to showcase items available for trade. It provides a user-friendly interface where members can list items they want to exchange, facilitating local transactions within the community. Additionally, the platform includes a messaging system allowing users to communicate privately with each other to discuss trade details, negotiate, and arrange meetups. To ensure the safety and reliability of the trading environment, a comprehensive rating and reporting system is integrated. This system allows users to rate their trading experiences and report any suspicious or unsafe activity, fostering a secure trading atmosphere within the Morgantown community.

## Motivation
This project is driven by the aspiration to cultivate a connected community in Morgantown through a dedicated platform for item exchanges, aiming to facilitate local interactions and the sharing of goods.
